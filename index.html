        <h3>How it all started:</h3>
        <p>During my last year of medical school, after finally completing all the coursework and rotating through every mandatory service, medical students are finally afforded some time to do electives. Some students decide to rotate through subspecialty fields they might be interested in but are not part of the core curriculum, some do research, and some do special projects. I had an interestin medical ethics and applied to and attended a medical ethics fellowship at Oxford University in the UK.I lived in Oxford for a month, reading with the medical ethics tutors there. I had always wanted to study in the UK and it was a bit of a dream come true. More than the study though, more than living in Oxford and experiencing the student life there, more than traveling around the UK in my free time, I was particularly excited for this fellowship. Oxford University was the place where one of my favorite authors, J.R.R. Tolkien, with whom I share a birthday, lived, taught and was buried.</p>

        <h3>The seed of an idea:</h3>
        <p>Long before I even thought of visiting Oxford, I knew about The Eagle &amp Child, the pub where Tolkien, along with C.S. Lewis and a few other authors, would meet as a group, The Inklings, as they called themselves. It was one of my first stops when I arrived. While I was having my first pint, sitting in the very booth that this now famous group of writers would regularly sit in, I thought of a way I could visit sites associated with Tolkien in a way that would be fun, meaningful, and unique (and, depending on you dear reader, perhaps a bit insane). I would find all of the spots around Oxford associated with Tolkien and spend a day walking around Oxford, stopping at each one to read a chapter of The Hobbit, culminating at The Eagle &amp Child where I would finish the book over a few pints.</p>

        <h3>The journey begins:</h3>
        <p>Since I was ending at the pub, I chose the point furthest away and walked inward. That made my first stop the cemetary where Tolkien and his wife a buried, just outside of Oxford. It was a small, otherwise non-descript cemetary, and in fact the grave a small and relatively non-descript grave; besides a few trinkets and poems left behind by some of the more, shall we say, devoted fan, you wouldn't know that one of the ost influentital writers of the last century was buried here. It was a beautifully mild (and dry) March day, and I plopped myself down next to the grave to read Chapter 1: "An Unexpected Party".</p>

        <h3>In a building above ground there lived an author</h3>
        <p>The next stop, on the walk towards the university, was the house that J.R.R. Tolkien lived in while at Oxford. Unlike the the gravesite, there was nothing to indicate the historic significance of the house besides a small blue plaque above one of the upper floor windows. It could have been any old house, on any old street, lived in by any old hobbit. I mean, professor. There wasn't even a bus stop bench to sit down on, so I sat on the curb and read Chapter 2: "Roast Mutton" (unfortunatley, without any mutton, but fortunately, without any trolls).</p>

        <h3>A short rest indeed</h3>
        <p>After chapter two was the walk to campus, where I would be for the rest of the day. With most of the walking behind me, the third chapter of the book was appropriately titled. Under his bust, at the entrance to Oxford's Exeter College, where the professor studied as an undergraduate, I read Chapter 3: "A Short Rest".</p>

        <h3>I dub thee Professor</h3>
        <p>After Tolkien graduated from Oxford, he was sent to France to fight in WWI, where he took part in the Battle of the Somme. When he next returned to Oxford University, it was as a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College. It was this title more than any other that he would be associated with; to this day, on his birthday (and mine), Tolkien fans will raise a glass "To The Professor". And it was at Pembroke that he accomplished much of what he would become famous for, both academic and literary. Here, he translated Beowulf and established, for the first time, the literary and historical significance of the epic poem beyond the purely linguistic interest shown in it up this point. And it was during his tenure at Pembroke that he wrote The Hobbit and the first two books of The Lord of the Rings. I sat in the quad of Pembroke College and read Chapter 4: "Over Hill and Under Hill".</p>

        <h3>What has it got in its pocketses?</h3>
        <p>Professor Tolkien's career at Oxford did not end at Pembroke College. After WWII he moved to Merton College as the Professor of English Language and Literature, where he stayed until his retirement, and he where he completed The Lord of the Rings. Just outside the chapel at Merton College, I sat and read perhaps the best chapter of the entire book, Chapter 5: "Riddles in the Dark". </p>

        <h3>"Many of those trees were my friends</h3>
        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Having capped of Tolkien's academic career, there was one more spot to visit before I could have a few drinks at the pub. At Oxford's Botanical Gardens there was a tree, a black pine, ancient, twisted, and majestic, that was one of Tolkien's favorite places to sit, and, allegedly, his inspiration for the tree-like Ents, the shepherds of the forest. That it did inspire him to create the Ents is undocumented, but upon seeing the tree, it was easy to believe. Set in an otherwise bucolic but tame garden, it towered over the lawns and plants like ancient creature from a bygone age, a 'giant' indeed (ent is the Anglo_Saxon word for giants). I sat under his soaring and gnarled branches and, the setting just too perfect to move on from, read two chapters, Chapter 6: "Out of the Frying Pan Into the Fire", and Chapter 7: "Queer Lodgings".</p>

        <h3>And Back Again</h3>
        <p>With the sun starting to go down on this shortened winter day, I made my way to The Eagle &amp Child, where I first had the idea for this pilgrimage of sorts. Luckily, the Inklings' booth was empty, so took a seat, perhaps on the very bench where Tolkien once sat to discuss his progress on the world of Middle-Earth with his friends. I ordered fish and chips and a pint (yes, they come in pints), and then a few more, as I read the rest of The Hobbit, from "Flies and Spiders" through "The Last Stage", where Gandalf says to Bilbo "...you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!", to which Bilbo replies, laughing, "Thank goodness!"</p>
